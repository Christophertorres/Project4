   <p> <span class="-Courier-New large -xlarge"> Weknew that Harry would not trust Mad Eye. Someone he has never met personally, someone who shows the darkest spells in their first class, Harry wouldn't have touched anything Mad Eye told him to with a ten foot pole.
We used the Tri-Wizard Tournament to make Harry trust Mad Eye and to distract and weaken him by the time Voldemort is back. And conceal Harry's death as part of the tournament to keep Voldemort's return a secret.
Also, with the absolute lack of planning in your "simplified" version, we would be absolutely screwed if it didn't work. We had one chance and they were going to obviously be careful and calculated in their plan. And the fact is, the plan worked. We got Harry where we wanted him, we got his blood to reinvigorate Voldemort, and Voldemort had his chance to kill Harry but Harry got away on his own merit. </p>
